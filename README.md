Visualizing Recursion
=====================

See: http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/23recursion/

Some minor changes to a few examples from above to help visualize recursion via function traces or animated rendering of recursive graphics.

Example
======================
* cd src
* sh run.sh Htree.java
